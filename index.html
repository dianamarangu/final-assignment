		<h3 id="heading3"> Tuberculosis (TB) is ancient and deadly </h3>
		<p> Consumption and the White Plague were words used in the past to refer to tuberculosis (TB), all connoting the deadly nature of this disease. 
		Indeed an ancient disease, the oldest evidence of TB in human beings dates back to over 9000 years ago from a Neolithic settlement in the Eastern 
		Mediterranean. </p> 
		<p></p>
		
		<h3 id="heading3"> Advances in bacteriological discovery, cure and prevention have been made</h3>
		<p> On March 24th 1884, the German scientist, Robert Koch, announced his discovery of the cause of this deadly disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
		In this knowledge lay the hope for an end to the scourge that had long afflicted the human race. Subsequent advances in TB were made including the 
		discovery of potent antibiotic regimens and laboratory diagnostic techniques. Indeed the world was making progress.</p>
		<p></p>
		
		<h3 id="heading3"> Moving beyond just tackling the bacteria...The WHO STOP TB Strategy was formulated </h3>
		
		<p> Despite these steps forward, TB was declared a global emergency in 1990. Strategies recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were put in place,
		including Directly Observed Treatment (DOTS), DOTS Plus and the current STOP TB strategy. Between 1990 and 2012, TB death rates dropped by 45% and WHO estimated that 22 million lives 
		were saved as a result of these strategies.</p>
		
		<p>The STOP TB Strategy	has 6 principle components which include:
			<ul>
				<li class="middle"> Pursuing high quality DOT expansion and enhancement </li>
				<li class="middle"> Addressing TB/HIV, MDR and other challenges </li>
				<li class="middle"> Contributing to Health System Strengthening  </li>
				<li class="middle"> Engaging all care providers </li>
				<li class="middle"> Empowering people with TB and communities </li>
				<li class="middle"> Enabling and promoting research. </li>
			</ul>
		<p></p>
		
		<h3 id="heading3"> BUT currently 80% of the global burden lies in 22 countries </h3>
		<p></P>
		<p>The number of people falling ill with TB annually is declining. The 2012 WHO global estimates of 8.6 million people sick with TB compared to 
		people in 2011 indicate that the world is on track to achieving the millennium development goal of reversing the spread of TB by 2015. The harsh 
		reality however is that great regional disparities exist. Sixty percent of new TB infections occur in Asia whereas sub Saharan Africa bears the 
		largest proportion of new TB cases per population with over 255 cases per 100,000 population. It is not surprising that this geographical pattern 
		follows that of HIV since TB-HIV co-infected individuals have about a 30-fold increased risk of falling ill with TB. South Africa has not been spared 
		and currently ranks 7th out of the 22 countries with the highest burden of disease - 80% of the global burden.</p>

		<h2 id="heading2"> What can we learn? </h2>
		
		<h3 id="heading3"> Which high burden countries (HBC) wholly took up respective components of the STOP TB Strategy in 2012? </h3>
		<h3 id="heading3"> What were the 2011 TB mortality outcomes in each HBC? </h3>
		<h3 id="heading3"> Did 2011 TB outcomes influence STOP TB Strategy uptake in 2012 in high burden countries? </h3>
		<h4 id="heading4"> Example:Mortality rate* (per 100 Pulmonary TB patients) in 2011 in relation to country specific strategy uptake in 2012 </h4>
